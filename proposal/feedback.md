This is definitely one of the more polished proposals, and it reads almost like a mini report already. The motivation is clear, the model plan is well thought out, and you clearly did your homework on what the leaderboard setup looks like. One small thing you might add is a short note on how you will verify the train and test splits match the leaderboard setup, since that part is usually what people get wrong when trying to reproduce results. Otherwise, this looks great and it is very obvious what you are going to do and why. If you want to go one step further (not required just if you have extra time, maybe do some rudimentary efficiency profiling to see if there exists noticeable efficiency trade offs between models? such as training and execution times simple your model choice complexities vary by quite a bit)
